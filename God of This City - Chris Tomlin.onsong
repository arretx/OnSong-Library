God of This City
Chris Tomlin
Key: [C]

Verse 1:
You'r the God of this City
You're the King of these people
You're the Lord of this nation... You are

You're the Light in this darkness
You're the hope to the hopeless
You're the Peace to the restless ... You are

Pre-chorus:
There is no one like our God
There is no one like our God

Chorus:
For greater things have yet to come
And greater things are still to be done in this City
