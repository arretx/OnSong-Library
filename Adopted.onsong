Adopted
Key: [E]

Verse 1:
[E]Hallelujah, [C#m]God has spoken,
And I [D]know[A] ... this changes [E]everything.
[E]Hallelujah, [C#m]praise Him only,
Sing the [D]slaves[A] ... adopted by[E] the King.

Chorus:
[B]Glory [A]be to my Father who [E]reigns!
For I [B]met Him and I [A]cannot be the [E]same.
When in [B]bondage, to [A]Jesus I [C#m]came.
He [A]took my place and He [C]cha[D]nged my [E]name.
