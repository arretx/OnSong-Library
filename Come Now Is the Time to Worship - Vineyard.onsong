Come Now Is the Time to Worship
Vineyard
Key: [C]

Verse 1:
Come, now is the time to worship.
Come, now is the time to give your heart.
Come, just as you are to worship.
Come, just as you are before your god.
Come.

One day every tongue will confess You are God
One day everyd knee will bow.
Still the greated streasure remains for those,
Who gladly choose you now.
